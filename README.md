# Airline-Review-Sentiment-Analysis---ML

The "Airplane Review Sentiment Analysis - Classification Machine Learning Project" addresses the crucial need to gauge public sentiment towards various airplane models. With the exponential growth of online reviews and opinions, understanding customer sentiments is essential for both airlines and manufacturers to enhance their services and products. This project leverages advanced techniques such as Sentiment Analysis using NLTK, Feature Engineering, Feature Selection, and Synthetic Minority Oversampling to preprocess and enrich the review dataset.

The core focus of the project lies in the implementation of the XGBoost (Extreme Gradient Boosting) classifier, a powerful ensemble learning algorithm. XGBoost iteratively refines multiple weak models (decision trees) into a robust predictive model. It combines the strengths of gradient boosting and regularization to minimize prediction errors and handle complex relationships within the data. XGBoost's unique gradient boosting framework optimizes both bias and variance, resulting in highly accurate predictions and efficient performance. This classification model will categorize airplane reviews into positive, negative, or neutral sentiments, enabling stakeholders to gain valuable insights into customer perceptions and make informed decisions for future improvements in the airline industry.
